<ul>
<li><a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/cpb/databases/gpdd">Global Popluation Dynamics Database</a> initiated package <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/rgpdd">rgpdd</a></li>
<li>data extraction – No API, but does provide direct dump in the form of a Microsoft Access <code>mdb</code> database. For the moment I’m using mdbtools: <code>mdb-tables</code> and <code>mdb-extract</code> to convert to CSV and then reading those into R. <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RODBC/index.html">RODBC</a> package installs but cannot read the database directly for me. Since data will fit into working memory no real reason to support database calls from R? (avoids extra dependencies). <code>data.table</code> should speed internal computations.<br /></li>
<li>data compression. Looks like raw data exceeds CRAN’s 5MB limit, but <code>zx</code> compressed binaries it will be less than <span class="math">\(&lt;0.4\)</span> MB. Compressing those from within R: <code>save(table_name, file=&quot;filename.rda&quot;, compress=&quot;xz&quot;)</code>. Looks like database is essentially static with updates every few years, see <a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/cpb/databases/gpdd/updates">Updates page</a>. Together this makes a good case for distributing data directly in the package.</li>
</ul>
<p>On distributing the data, note:</p>
<p>“Not all of the data in GPDD is in the public domain; some are provided under licence from the BTO. We require permission before we can distribute some of the data sets. The data in these datasets have been removed from the DATA table in this online version of GPDD, but the metadata in the other tables has been left in place.” http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/cpb/databases/gpdd/structure</p>
<p>Emailed database providers to confirm.</p>

<li><p>ugh should implement script to transform DOIs to links+metadata. probably <code>knitcitations</code> based, but without needing the verbose <code>r citep(&quot;</code> notation. pity markdown doesn’t support <code>rel</code> attribute on links. Maybe possible already? https://drupal.org/node/421832 No luck there, though pandoc can avoid choking on this style of link attribute: https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/wiki/Pandoc-vs-Multimarkdown#image-and-link-attributes when compiling with <code>-f markdown+link_attributes</code>. Unfortunately this doesn’t actually render the attributes but just silently drops them.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>I mentioned my involvement started with <a href="http://carlboettiger.info/2013/06/13/what-I-look-for-in-software-papers.html">this post</a>; the (somewhat long) comments are useful.</p></li>
<li><p>I should have mentioned that recently attended a workshop where environmental scientists were thinking about how to approach these issues related to software and code through the creation of a <a href="http://isees.nceas.ucsb.edu">Software Sustainability Center</a>. (Of which code review could be one possible service it might provide).</p></li>
<li><p>I might have mentioned that a few organizations are doing code review. Notably, the journal of open research, published by the new UK Software Sustainability Institute. They are one of the few organziations that have <a href="http://carlboettiger.info/2013/07/09/reviewing-software-revisited.html">code review guidelines</a></p></li>
<li><p>Code review was recently <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1231535">proposed</a> and <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.341.6143.236-b">disputed</a> in a Policy Forum piece in Science Magazine discussing these issues.</p></li>
<li><p>This Times Higher Ed article recently highlighted the issues with Climate code: http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/save-your-work-give-software-engineers-a-career-track/2006431.article The Climate Code Foundation http://climatecode.org/ is doing excellent work to start addressing these issues.</p></li>
<li><p>Of course several earlier articles in Nature have highlighted these issues, including the important tension between encouraging scientists to <a href="http://doi.org/10.1038/nature10836">share code even if it isn’t “pretty”</a>, vs <a href="http://doi.org/10.1038/467775a">improving the quality / readability of code</a>.</p></li>

<p>Have implemented a solution to extending <code>data.frame</code> with metadata that I was <a href="http://carlboettiger.info/2013/09/11/extending-data-frame-class.html">tackling the other day</a>. This raises several open questions on how we do the implementation, including whether we restrict this extension to providing the <code>attributeList</code>-level metadata (or a subset thereof), or if we allow higher level nodes of <code>eml</code> to act as extensions of <code>data.frame</code> (e.g. <code>dataTable</code>, which provides additional metadata attributes such as <code>entityTitle</code>, as well as the <code>physical</code> description of the <code>csv</code> file.</p>
<p>Matt raises good points about what attribute data we want. Most we have addressed already, but this does raise additional challenges as well. See issue <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/reml/issues/47">#47</a> for details and further discussion.</p>

<p>I’d like to define a class that acts just like a <code>data.frame</code>, just like the <code>data.table</code> class does, but contains some additional metadata (e.g. the units associated with the columns) and has some additional methods associated with it (e.g. that might do something with those units) while also working with any function that simply knows how to handle <code>data.frame</code> objects.</p>
<p>How might this be done?</p>
<hr />
<p><em>I’m not really sure where to start on this, so below is a summary of my attempt so far and some further puzzles I have stumbled across (e.g. is a <code>data.frame</code> and S4 object?). This seems to work, but might not be the best way to go about it.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>If I understood what the data structure underlying <code>data.frame</code> was, I might have a better idea how to extend it. But I don’t know what makes a <code>data.frame</code> a <code>data.frame</code>, as the exploration below will illustrate:</p>
<p>For instance, it’s not clear if I should try writing my extended object as an S3 or an S4 object that inherits <code>data.frame</code>. When is a <code>data.frame</code> an S4 object and when is it an S3 object?</p>
<pre><code>A &lt;- new(&quot;data.frame&quot;)
isS4(A) </code></pre>
<p>returns <code>TRUE</code>, suggesting that data.frames are S4 objects and that we might start with: <code>setClass(&quot;myclass&quot;, contains=&quot;data.frame&quot;)</code>. However,</p>
<pre><code>B &lt;- data.frame(x = rnorm(10))
isS4(B) </code></pre>
<p>returns <code>FALSE</code>, suggesting that <code>data.frames</code> are S3 classes, and perhaps I should consider starting with</p>
<p>attr(B, “class”) &lt;- c(“myclass”, “data.frame”)</p>
<p>It appears that a data.frame is built upon a list, since</p>
<pre><code>is.list(data.frame(x = rnorm(10)))</code></pre>
<p>gives <code>TRUE</code>.</p>
<p>Despite <code>isS4(B)</code> being <code>FALSE</code>, we find that the S4 method <code>slotNames(B)</code> gives:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; slotNames(B)
[1] &quot;.Data&quot;     &quot;names&quot;     &quot;row.names&quot; &quot;.S3Class&quot; </code></pre>
<p>suggesting that <code>data.frame</code> is an S4 object, with a (unnamed?) list in <code>.Data</code> and nonempty values in <code>names</code>, along with the slot “.S3Class” containing the string “data.frame”.</p>
<p>Interestingly:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>B@names</code> returns an error, while <code>slot(B, &quot;names&quot;)</code> returns <code>&quot;x&quot;</code>. (Suggesting <code>B</code> is S3, with some <code>slot</code> method defined?)<br /></li>
<li><code>B@.Data</code> returns an unnamed length-1 list containing a numeric vector with our 10 random values. (and illustrating a working <code>@</code> accessor, suggesting <code>B</code> is S4.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Very confusing.</p>
<hr />
<p>From this exploration, I conclude that I can promote a <code>list</code> to a <code>data.frame</code> by providing an unnamed list, editing the “class” attribute, and then assigning values to the slots <code>names</code> and <code>row.names</code>:</p>
<pre><code>obj &lt;- list(rnorm(10))
attr(obj, &quot;class&quot;) &lt;- &quot;data.frame&quot;
slot(obj, &quot;names&quot;) &lt;- &quot;x&quot;
slot(obj, &quot;row.names&quot;) &lt;- 1:10</code></pre>
<p>And indeed <code>obj</code> acts like a proper <code>data.frame</code> (at least it prints like one).</p>
<p>This suggests that I could extend <code>data.frame</code> by adding a new slot for my units, like so:</p>
<p>setClass(“myclass”, representation(units = “character”), contains=“data.frame”)</p>
<p>But this does not inherit the slotNames <code>names</code>, <code>row.names</code>, <code>.S3Class</code>. I try assigning these explicitly,</p>
<pre><code>setClass(&quot;myclass&quot;, 
         representation(units = &quot;character&quot;,
                        names = &quot;character&quot;,
                        row.names = &quot;integer&quot;,
                        .S3Class = &quot;character&quot;),
                        contains = &quot;list&quot;)

obj &lt;- new(&quot;myclass&quot;, names=&quot;x&quot;, row.names=1:10, units = &quot;degrees Celsius&quot;)
obj@.Data &lt;- list(rnorm(10))
obj@.S3Class &lt;- &quot;data.frame&quot;</code></pre>
<p>but this new object is not a <code>data.frame</code>. Finally we add</p>
<pre><code>attr(obj, &quot;class&quot;) &lt;- &quot;data.frame&quot; </code></pre>
<p>and we have a successful extension that acts like a data frame. Some weird things of note: It appears that .S3Class needs to be assigned as above with <code>@</code>, and not as a named argument in <code>new</code> or as part of the <code>prototype</code>.</p>
<p>This last step is almost certainly not what we really want to do, since it destroys our new class assigment (<code>myclass</code>). We really want the object to have two classes, <code>myclass</code> and <code>data.frame</code>. However, if we do <code>attr(obj, &quot;class&quot;) &lt;- c(&quot;myclass&quot;, &quot;data.frame&quot;)</code>, then the object does not behave as a <code>data.frame</code> at all.</p>
<p>One might thing that the solution would be to then define all the S3 methods as copies of those avialable for data.frames, e.g. define <code>print.myclass &lt;- print.data.frame</code>. Unfortunately this doesn’t quite work (appears not to get <code>row.names</code> and hence prints column headings but not data. Defining the S4 method for <code>row.names</code> with <code>myclass</code> signature doesn’t fix this either…).</p>

<p>Near the end of another excellent day of discussions we were asked to put pen to paper to outline our own views in writing. My own contribution was the following notebook scribble.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>My own vision of what ISEES should be doing for workforce development:</em></p>
<p>ISEES would employ a multi-scale approach to improve basic computational expertise across the entire workforce necessary to fully participate in the modern software-immersed world of research through the development of <em>training standards</em>, while using a <em>working-group model</em> focused on emerging researcher-developer communities which would simultaneously improve the quality and synthesis of existing software tools while also delivering essential skills to the most transformative members of the research software communities.</p>
<p>Development and promotion of standards for computational training. A workshop model could allow these to be written and updated by the community. These could serve as a guideline for curriculum development and play a key role in assessment. Curriculum review panels within departments, as well as reviewers of grants which include a component of computational training, would at least have such consensus standards to which they could point, either to reject sub-standard practices or make the case for increased resources to meet these goals. Curriculum should be geared towards inclusion of this training as part of domain-specific classes rather than extramural classes.</p>
<p>Working groups or hack-a-thons bringing together “researcher-developer” domain scientists with software engineering experts would simultaneously provide a direct benefit to “hardening” (improving the interoperability, scalability, and sustainability) of existing software while also training the most influential members of the research community who are most frequently involved in training other domain scientists. By organizing such working groups around existing research communities, the incentive to participate would be higher as the outputs would be more directly aligned with existing research programmes, while at the same time training the researchers most active in software development in their domain and most likely to teach these skills to others.</p>
<p>Thirdly, ISEES should support workshops or small conferences to address developing concerns in software workforce training, including issues such as assessing current training practices, measuring improvement and the impact of the center, or challenges in software career paths.</p>
<hr />
<p>Didn’t really jot many notes down in today’s session, but will instead link the excellent prepared by our awesome expert facilitator <a href="https://twitter.com/ninmah">Rachel Smith</a>.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>Ever since writing the <code>rfishbase</code> package I’ve been frustrated by the lack of a proper API from Fishbase.org that would allow access to that wealth of information that is not exposed in the “Summary XML” files from which <code>rfishbase</code> extracts its content. Since writing the paper in Journal of Fish Biology, I continue to receive user requests asking if or how such-and-such a data element might be extracted. Usually this involves a disappointing boiler-plate reply about how the package is limited to the “Summary XML” data and that improved query potential must wait for a proper API from Fishbase.org at some unspecified time.</p>
<p>I have been in touch with many of the folks at Fishbase.org at various times looking for ways to address these issues. They have been in general keenly supportive of the idea, but I gather that they are largely overworked and under-resourced and as such, implementation of any of these steps has been very slow. Last October another rfishbase user contacted me, who works full time as a software developer. I put him in touch with the UBC team, and he is willing to volunteer the hours and expertise the FishBase development team lacks to help transform the database into a full API. I think this is a very promising development and a nice example of a community effort, but still faces the same fundamental challenges in getting things rolling. So, so far, no <code>rfishbase</code> version 2. (Actually in our semantic versioning it would be the less romantic version 0.3 or 0.4 or so, depending on how many CRAN submits we do before then and provided we don’t break any backwards compatibility)…</p>
<p>One of the more frequent requests involves accessing quantitative trophic level estimates provided for many species on the “Ecology” page, linked from the “Summary page”. The only way to access this data is by scraping the HTML.</p>
<p>Previously I’ve been reluctant to scrape the HTML directly for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It is generally unrealiable/unverifiable. Without any metadata (rdfa or microdata/microformats could have helped…) in the HTML to signpost that we have the correct value, we are generally counting arbitrary header, div and span elements, followed by some Regular Expression matching, to find the element we want.<br />This is error-prone and easily broken by any changes in the html pages either over time or between pages for different species.</p></li>
<li><p>Second, it puts a much greater load on the fishbase servers. Often we cannot even start by querying the page we want, (e.g. since URLs involve things like stock-ids that the end user will not know and I haven’t located a look-up table), so a single call may follow links through several pages before parsing the data it needs. Repeating such queries over many fish programmatically can create a rather substantial burst of traffic that could slow or crash the servers.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s slow. Making all the queries takes time, even for a computer. (Though caching, as we already do in rfishbase, could take care of much this).</p></li>
<li><p>It is potentially time consuming and annoying to code the scaping.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, the last is just me being lazy. Since this particular query about trophic level was a common email request, and as the data was available from the “Ecology” page of a species in the form of an HTML Table, (and hence somewhat less fragile to robustly identify…), I thought I’d give it a try.</p>
<p>Here’s my approach (or see <a href="">source code</a>). We would follow the same query structure as <code>getSize</code> did <sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>, and execute several steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Visit the Summary page of the requested fish</li>
<li>Find it’s Ecology page</li>
<li>Find the Trophic level table</li>
<li>parse the table.</li>
</ol>
<p>In code, that looks like this:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">getTrophicLevel &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>function(<span class="dt">fish.data =</span> <span class="ot">NULL</span>,
                            <span class="dt">path =</span> <span class="ot">NULL</span>,
                            <span class="dt">as_table=</span><span class="ot">FALSE</span>, 
                            <span class="dt">from =</span> <span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="st">&quot;diet composition&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;individual food items&quot;</span>), 
                            <span class="dt">unfished =</span> <span class="ot">FALSE</span>,
                            <span class="dt">justSE =</span> <span class="ot">FALSE</span>,
                            <span class="dt">justReference =</span> <span class="ot">FALSE</span>){

  ids &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">getIds</span>(<span class="dt">fish.data =</span> fish.data, <span class="dt">path=</span>path)
  out &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">sapply</span>(ids, function(id){
    summaryPage &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">getSummary</span>(id)

    else

    })
  out
}</code></pre>
<p>Which has a whole bunch of options just to let the user control the format of the output / target value, since there are different numbers.</p>
<p>Each of the steps corresponds to it’s own function:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">getIds &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>function(<span class="dt">fish.data=</span><span class="ot">NULL</span>, <span class="dt">path=</span><span class="ot">NULL</span>){

  tab &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">readHTMLTable</span>(ecologyPage)[[<span class="dv">6</span>]]
}</code></pre>
<p>which are all nice and short and potentially self-explanatory. Extracting values from the table we isolate is done rather crudely at the moment and could no doubt be improved, but this is what I came up with:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">parseTrophicLevel &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>function(tab, 
                              <span class="dt">from =</span> <span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="st">&quot;diet composition&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;individual food items&quot;</span>),

                              <span class="dt">justSE =</span> <span class="ot">FALSE</span>,
                              <span class="dt">justReference =</span> <span class="ot">FALSE</span>){
  from &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">match.arg</span>(from)
  if(justReference)
    out &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">as.character</span>(tab[<span class="dv">3</span>,<span class="dv">2</span>])
  else{
    col &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">2</span>
    adj &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">0</span>
    if(unfished)
      col &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">4</span>

      out &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">as.numeric</span>(<span class="kw">as.character</span>(tab[<span class="dv">2</span>,col+adj]))

      out &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">as.numeric</span>(<span class="kw">as.character</span>(tab[<span class="dv">4</span>,col+adj]))
  }
  out 
}</code></pre>
<p>Most of these are internal functions of course, only the top <code>getTrophicLevel</code> is user-facing.<br />The use is straight forward:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">require</span>(rfishbase)
<span class="kw">data</span>(fishbase)

<span class="kw">getTrophicLevel</span>(fish.data[<span class="dv">1</span>:<span class="dv">10</span>])</code></pre>
<p>or any of the various optional configurations, e.g.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">getTrophicLevel</span>(fish.data[<span class="dv">1</span>:<span class="dv">10</span>], <span class="dt">as_table=</span><span class="ot">TRUE</span>)</code></pre>
<p>(which gives a list of tables matching these fish).</p>
<p>The astute reader might notice that with <code>EcologyPage</code> etc we have access to a lot more (tabular) data in this approach, which could be extended beyond that page as well, following the same template shown here. Just a matter of time and the other limitations discussed above.</p>
<p>So anyway, if you need the getTrophicLevel, it’s available now on the <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/rfishbase/issues/12">Github version</a> and should be on CRAN in the near future. Meanwhile, I’d certainly welcome other requests (or better yet, forks and pull requests implementing additional data fields along these same lines).</p>

<p>We have also recently reached the first <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/RNeXML/issues?milestone=1&amp;state=closed">milestone</a> in <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/RNeXML">RNeXML</a>. We can now read NeXML files into R and convert to the popular <code>phylo</code> format from the <code>ape</code> package, as well as writing the <code>ape::phylo</code> trees out into valid NeXML. We can also add basic metadata such as author, license, title and description to the file.</p>
<h3 id="development-notes">Development notes</h3>
<p>At the heart of this package is an internal S4 representation of the schema. While knowledgable users could interact with the S4 objects directly (easier and less error-prone than interacting with the XML parsing/serializing directly), we in general provide an end-user API which hides the internal complexity of S4 classes, as illustrated below. In principle this representation could be automatically generated from the schema using the <code>XMLSchema</code> package, but that must wait until that package is more mature. Meanwhile, we rely on hand-coded classes and hand-coded coercion functions.</p>
<p>The coercion functions take care of the translation into and out of the XML (parsing and serializing) without any need for xpath expressions. At the moment they are verbosely spelled out under the class definitions in classes.R file, though ideally they could be abstracted (e.g. as we do in <code>reml</code>). Classes are based on the <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/RNeXML/issues/1#issuecomment-22867535">inheritance structure</a> of the schema (unlike <code>reml</code>), which makes additional nodes much easier to add and hence it is easier to extend this library. At this time we have only certain core elements from the schema as map naturally to <code>ape</code> trees, along with the essential annotation elements (<code>meta</code> nodes). Support for additional classes / schema elements will be added as driven by use cases.</p>
<p>(See the <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/RNeXML">Github page</a> for the most recent tutorial, this is just added here for my record).</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>Guess it’s that time of year again. Just saw the reminder for <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503622&amp;WT.mc_id=USNSF_39&amp;WT.mc_ev=click">this year’s RFP for NSF Biology Post-docs</a>. As I was fortunate enough to receive one of these for the “Mathematical Biology” track through last year’s call, I have received a few requests for materials and advice. I’m not sure if I have any more insight for having received this funding, but as I appreciated the advice of others this time last year I’ll give it a shot. I found it particularly useful to see another proposal, particularly one that was also from a theoretical angle, so I am grateful to <a href="http://whitelab.weecology.org/">Ethan White</a> for sharing his successful proposal <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.93938">on figshare</a> (though for a call under “Bioinformatics” rather than “Mathematical Biology”). So naturally, my own full proposal can be found <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.652970">on figshare</a>. (This is also linked from my vita, which hasn’t proven very discoverable). While I do not feel it appropriate to post my reviews (after all, they are not written with the expectation of public release and I don’t own the copyright to them), you can drop me an email if you would like to see these privately.</p>
<p>In that spirit, here is a bit of background on my own proposal with some general reflections on my reviews, both as a chance for me to think about the feedback I received as I now embark on this proposed research, and for whatever value it may have to this year’s applicants.</p>
<hr />
<p>In July I officially started my NSF mathematical biology post-doc with mentors Marc Mangel and Steve Munch: <em>Management for an uncertain world: robust decision theory in face of regime shifts</em>. Over the next two years, this research will focus primarily in pursing three questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Can early warning signals be incorporated into decision-theoretic approaches to decrease the chance of an undesirable critical transition?</strong><br /></li>
<li><strong>Can the use of non-parametric and machine learning approaches to ecosystem modeling and prediction decrease or increase the chance of an undesirable transition?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What learning strategies can be employed to reduce uncertainty without increasing the chance of accidentally crossing a tipping point?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The project brings me into rather new ground into at least two new methodologies (Optimal control, specifically through stochastic dynamic programming – something I have been recently introduced to by economists in a NIMBIOS working group) and a new ecological system (fisheries dynamics). I had to smile on seeing that some of my reviewers fretted that the project sounded too similar to my thesis work. While potentially understandable from a comparison of my thesis title and my NSF proposal title, I had feared the actual content had more the opposite problem.<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Overall my reviews were somewhat more applied than I anticipated, focusing much more on the conceptual goals of the research than the details of the implementation. In retrospect this was probably fortuitous, as I did not have space to fully develop the technical challenges in some of these areas, which are at points formidable (several areas involve methodology that is quite new to me. Question 3 in particular draws on two classically hard problems and I worry myself if I will have the capacity to tackle it effectively). From others I understand that my proposal was potentially somewhat more focused on big picture issues than on implementation details, which may not always be advisable but worked well in this case. It’s unclear to me if this is typical of more theoretical proposals or just luck.</p>
<h3 id="broader-impacts-and-the-open-notebook">Broader Impacts and the Open Notebook</h3>
<p>NSF gives quite a wide range of potential areas for broader impacts. The 2013 changes only made this more vague, extending the listed examples and emphasizing that they were meant to be illustrative, not prescriptive. A particularly promising change comes in using the same <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_3.jsp#IIIA2">criteria as the merit review</a>; emphasizing that the effectiveness of the impact is assessed, and that the applicant is well-qualified for the task. Though I have volunteered much of my adult life with non-profit organizations working with under-served youth in my <a href="/community.html">community</a>, I did not think it appropriate to shoehorn those activities into my proposal. For these reasons I chose not to focus on broadening participation of under-represented groups in this proposal, and instead emphasize three of five (now eight) suggested areas that I felt I could effectively impact through my open lab notebook: education, dissemination, and infrastructure.</p>
<p>I think this was a bit of a gamble, focusing on something that was both more unique to me and that I could implement and assess well, rather than on something more traditionally recognized for broader impacts. It is difficult to know just what my panel thought of this idea – but my impressions is that “good enough” might be the general sentiment. Comments included:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The PI operates a blog (open notebook) that already receives attention and is an interesting way to promote engagement and learning across a broad community of scientific peers and perhaps the public.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the notebook/blog could be developed into an online asynchronous classroom to mentor others in applying the results.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The blog is a good idea for dissemination of results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whether or not this was a lukewarm endorsement of the open notebook, I’m excited that as part of my proposal the practice is officially part of my supported proposal and not merely a time-saving endeavor for myself. Though the more technical features seemed to be of little interest to my reviewers, I’ll nonetheless particularly interested in exploring the potential to better leverage such elements as <a href="http://carlboettiger.info/2013/04/04/notebook-parsing.html">semantic markup</a> and <a href="http://carlboettiger.info/2013/05/03/notebook-features-hashes-providing-an-immutable-and-verifiable-research-record.html">hashes</a> in the notebook as I move forward with my research.</p>
<h3 id="reflections-on-data-management">Reflections on Data Management</h3>
<p>The data management plan is supposed to be assessed under both ‘Intellectual Merit’ and ‘Broader Impact’ sections where applicable,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Data Management Plan will be reviewed as an integral part of the proposal, coming under Intellectual Merit or Broader Impacts or both, as appropriate for the scientific community of relevance.” <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf13001/gpg_2.jsp#IIC2j">NSF GPG</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>which may have the effect that it is assessed under neither, unless a reviewer particularly cares about this section. I saw no mention of it in my own reviews. I have posted a draft of my <a href="http://carlboettiger.info/2012/10/09/data-management-plan.html">data management plan</a> previously. Having recently become familiar with the Ecological Metadata Standard I will probably amend the plan to reflect this.</p>
<h4 id="weaknesses">Weaknesses</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>One reviewer expresses a desire for a case-study application</li>
<li>One suggests more on broader public and under-served groups</li>
<li>One feels the proposal has “some similarities to the dissertation”</li>
</ol>
<section class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>After moving from an undergraduate in physics, I did my best to stitch my graduate work for an evolution and ecology PhD under a unifying theme in my dissertation, but it could hardly have been more across the map. My dissertation had three papers: one in Adaptive Dynamics, one in Comparative Phylogenetics, and one in warning signals of ecological shifts – there was no overlap in authors and essentially no overlap in the topic or reference lists (Okay, Cox 1968, in the latter two). I didn’t even attempt to weave in my two ecoinformatics papers. My undergraduate was similarly varied. I spent summer 2004 in an astrophysics lab (lambda CDM models with Neta Bahcall), 2005 sequencing extremeophilic microbes in a geomicrobiology lab (with TC Onstott), 2006 doing computational methods for boundary value problems during a plasma physics fellowship (with Hersh Rabitz). Though a physics major I wrote my first JP on population dynamics under clonal interference (David Huse), my second on adaptive dynamics (with Joshua Weitz), and my thesis on forest canopy models (with Stephen Pacala). It’s all a logical path of closely connected ideas in my mind of course ;-)<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>
