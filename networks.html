<p>Links to my more commonly used social network profiles and internet habitat, with a few comments. I am pretty consistently found under the user handle <code>cboettig</code> on social networks, though no guarentees.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://github.com/cboettig">Github</a></strong> The web-based home of my research. Star, watch, or fork a project you’re interested in.<br /></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://twitter.com/cboettig">Twitter</a></strong> My primary social network, which is why it gets a contact link in my footer.<br /></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/258662/carl">StackOverflow</a></strong> Profile includes links to other stackexchange platforms I use. Reputation should give some idea of how active I am on each)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://plus.google.com/112929796403983408632/about">Google Plus</a></strong> Largely a subset of my Twitter feed. Does facilitate a bit more extended discussion</li>
<li><strong><a href="">Google Scholar profile</a></strong> See what Google thinks are my publications, along with it’s take on my citation data. Sign up for alerts!</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.mendeley.com/profiles/carl-boettiger/">Mendeley Profile</a></strong> I maintain several public groups reflecting my reading in various projects.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://figshare.com/authors/Carl%20Boettiger/96387">Figshare</a></strong> Figshare is my go-to database for robust permanent archiving of other scholarly outputs, including grant applications, theses, etc.<br /></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/cboettig/">Flickr</a></strong> Most of my research scripts automatically post a copy of any figure they generate to Flickr. This creates a deal of junk and a lot of duplication, (which is why I stick with flickr, rather than crowding up my personal hosting or a more formal outlet such as Figshare), but it also provides a timestamped, linkable record of just about everything I look at. Images can be tagged by project, which is only semi-automated (I have to add a line in the research script identifying the project. Recent images should at least automatically include there hashes, which at least theoretically would allow me to identify the project and commit during which the image was generated.<br /></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/cboettig">Slideshare</a></strong> I try and keep most of my presentations archived on Slideshare, which provides convenient statistics and embedded viewing tools. Previously I archived slides and posters on Nature’s Preceedings preprint server, and may shift to Figshare for this purpose.<br /></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/cboettig/">Linkedin</a></strong> I don’t use the platform much, but I suppose it can make a handy address book?</li>
</ul>
<p>I have profiles on a handful of academic networking sites (ResearchGate, Academia.edu) which personally I have found in no way useful.</p>
