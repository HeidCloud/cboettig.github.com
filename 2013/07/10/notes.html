<ul>
<li><p>TODO: Post to arxiv now that Drake’s side is out. Update vita. Reply to Drake. Clean up prosectors-fallacy repository. Post on paper(?)</p></li>
<li><p>Note: github record of earlier version of paper turns out handy in reply, (showed earlier wording about not necessary).</p></li>
<li><p>Also, some quick significance testing of <a href="https://github.com/cboettig/prosecutors-fallacy/blob/092b004616e2859c1ab1a2d64892c641c7a527d0/inst/doc/sig-tests.md">distributional differences</a> associated with the patterns we show in Figure 1, for what it’s worth (in reply to query - yay for clean workflow making this easy).</p></li>
<li><p>one day, follow up with Sebastian about the Freidlin-Wentzell work. “Yes, I’d be interested in trying a little dynamic programming for the discrete-time variational problem; it would be educational for me at least, and potentially applicable to some more specific research questions.” (me, April 23).</p></li>
<li><p>Read remaining articles in special issue of TE on warning signals, write out notes. Clear out ‘unsorted’ backlog</p></li>
<li><p>forking the r-journal; see separate post.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://smallpondscience.com/2013/04/15/transparency-in-research-publish-your-reviews/">Excellent and provactive example by McGlynn</a>, who links all reviews on papers to which he is a first author (the full cascade, not just reviews from the journal that ultimately accepted the paper). Comments</p></li>
<li><p>More thoughts and some comments from me on <a href="http://timotheepoisot.fr/2013/07/10/sharing-reviews">Tim’s blog</a></p></li>
<li><p>Celebrating seven years of Biology Direct <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1745-6150-8-11">Koonin et al 2013</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://figshare.com/articles/Moving_toward_a_sustainable_ecological_science_don_t_let_data_go_to_waste_/693745">Poisot et al</a> on data sharing. Nice piece, but the value of a metadata standard for distributing data is clearly not appreciated. Authors advocate data shared over an API without any notion of schema, and do not discuss the challenges and coarse-graining that goes into such vertically integrated repositories.</p>
<h3 id="reviewing-the-new-broader-impacts-guidelines">Reviewing the new Broader impacts guidelines</h3>
<p>2013 changes removes the examples, adds three new potential areas, and now uses the same assessment guidelines as the merit review does – importantly: requiring metrics of success.</p>
